This is an example file pretending to be a file containing unpublished data.

It has the text "unpublished" in the filename, so will be ignored by .gitignore.

Any unpublished data should either have "unpublished" in it's filename or have 
its location and filename added to the .gitignore file. In both cases, the file
also needs to be added to datafiles_log.csv. In doing so, this will prevent the 
file from being uploaded to the remote repository.
