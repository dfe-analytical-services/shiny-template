# This is the server file.
# Use it to create interactive elements like tables, charts and text for your app.
#
# Anything you create in the server file won't appear in your app until you call it in the UI file.
# This server script gives an example of a plot and value box that updates on slider input.
# There are many other elements you can add in too, and you can play around with their reactivity.
# The "outputs" section of the shiny cheatsheet has a few examples of render calls you can use:

#
# This is the server logic of a Shiny web application. You can run the
# application by clicking 'Run App' above.
